## My Process

I developed the Geo IP Lookup Application to provide users with a simple interface to retrieve and visualize geographical information. It integrates multiple APIs and features dynamic map rendering with Leaflet.

### Built With

- **React**: Component-based UI for the app.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better reliability and maintainability.
- **SCSS**: Modular, maintainable stylesheets.
- **Leaflet**: To render dynamic maps.
- **Debounced Search**: To optimize input handling.

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:

- **API Integration**: Handling different APIs for IP address and domain resolution.
- **Leaflet**: Using Leaflet to display location data on interactive maps.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing effective error handling for API issues and user input.
- **Debounced Search**: Optimizing search functionality to reduce API load.
- **Responsive Design**: Using SCSS and responsive techniques for a smooth user experience.

### Continued Development

Future improvements will focus on:

- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improving the overall user interface with animations and interactions.
- **Advanced Features**: Adding additional data points or features like IP history tracking.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensuring the app is fully accessible to all users.
